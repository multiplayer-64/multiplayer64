## How to Play
Download [mu64-compiler](https://github.com/multiplayer-64/mu64-compiler/releases/latest/download/mu64-compiler.exe)

## Goal (accomplished)
Create a mod for the PC port where multiple people can play online together.

Unlike previous multiplayer projects, this one synchronizes enemies and events. This allows players to interact with the same world at the same time.

## Lua
multiplayer64 is moddable via Lua, similar to Roblox and Garry's Mod's Lua APIs. To get started, click [here](docs/lua/lua.md) to see the Lua documentation.
